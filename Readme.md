Comparison of four artificial neural networks (ANNs) built using different optimization algorithms and packages is presented. The ANNs are named ANN-ACO, ANN-PSO, ANN-GA, and ANN-CA, respectively. ANN-ACO was developed using the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, ANN-PSO with the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, ANN-GA with the Genetic Algorithm, and ANN-CA with the Cultural Algorithm. The packages used for building these ANNs include Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, and Pygad. Among these ANNs, ANN-PSO achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, followed by ANN-GA and ANN-CA, which achieved an accuracy of 90%. ANN-ACO, with an accuracy of 89%, achieved the lowest performance among the four ANNs.
